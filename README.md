# CoreDumpARM
A memory core dump framework that stores crash information including call stacks on ARM CPUs.

A full ARM core dump source code implementation using Keil uVision. The source was written using the free Keil MDK-Lite and ARM STM32F103 simulator so no target hardware was required. The code is simple and easily ported to ARM or any other embedded platform.

See the link below for an article explaining this source code and how to create an embedded core dump.
